This html program is a basic Rock paper scissors game
played via the console on a browser.

I have done this as part of The Odin Project. 

There are still some things I am yet to learn, and I intend
to come back to this game at a later date to update it with
any new methods I have learnt.

I have used git to push changes to my Github repository.
